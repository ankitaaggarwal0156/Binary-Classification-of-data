# Binary-Classification-of-data

When Data is linearly separable :
Implement the Perceptron Learning algorithm. Run it on the data file "classification.txt"
ignoring the 5th column. That is, consider only the first 4 columns in each row. The first 3 columns are
the coordinates of a point; and the 4th column is its classification label +1 or -1. Report your results.

When Data is not linearly separable :
Implement the Pocket algorithm and run it on the data file "classification.txt" ignoring the 4th
column. That is, consider only the first 3 columns and the 5th column in each row. The first 3 columns
are the coordinates of a point; and the 5th column is its classification label +1 or -1. Plot the number of
misclassified points against the number of iterations of the algorithm. Run up to 7000 iterations.
